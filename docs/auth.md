- users login via command line or web interface by sshing w/ their github public key to some random host

- then we track them by their github name

- curses and web uis hit same api

- can use same model for validating outputs from levels - this makes it easy to do arbitrary outputs (i.e. verify that there are x volumes mounted as filesystems)

- thus might end up with a dockerfile for each level to run on some low-level aws hardware for awhile to do the verification
